# Overview
This repository includes my individual portfolio of project: Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Engagement (Group Social Media1). The project was built upon Data Science of Smart Environment course hold by Wageningen UR. In this portfolio, I will mainly reflect on the work I have done to accomplish my personal learning goals.
## I. Personal Learning Goals
As a future urban designer or environmental issue consultor, I expect myself to know how to appropriately interrupt and interact with the environment in the big data era instead of being blind about the reality per se. Thus, I identified 3 learning goals in the course to approach to my expectation: 
* **Data acquisition and wrangling**: my original learning goal used to be data acquiring solely, which was to learn the complete process of retrieving data from Twitter API, as well as its functionality and limitations. For example, how many tweets are we able to get, in what time-period; are we able to filter the tweets by certain topic or location; Is that possible to identify different category to an interactive communication? However, the task seems to be not so challenging. Questions were naturally answered when me and Sam worked together to successfully get Twitter data. Moreover, to achieve my learning goal of data analyzing, it is necessary to know how the data was preprocessed or to implement some new wrangling methods.
* **Data visualization and analysis**: I cut goals of applying natural language processing and making story map for our project for this part, because these tasks did not require any cooperation. So, people who was more experienced in our group could already handle the tasks efficiently. However, I still want to learn story map making and applying ChatGPT API for NLP after the course. By working on the project, I would like to get familiar with programming in Python (utilize tutorials), coworking in Jupyter notebook or Google Colab (not feasible since Colab cannot work in a normal way when multiple people open the same document), data analyzing in Pandas and data visualization by matplotlib. Afterwards, a clear image of the whole workflow should be formed in my head. 
* **Quality, social and privacy**: reflective thinking of our results is very important, which may come out that source datasets are skewed, ethical issues, and the underlying causes of our results. Especially, I want to learn more about ethical issues on data utilization. I knew the privacy crisis of Facebook and the discussion about cookies of website. But the logic behind it is not so clear for me. When will data processing have social impacts, and what is the legal boundaries of it? My understanding of these questions could be included in our ethical document. Moreover, feedbacks from the teacher suggested me to also reflect on my own actions and activities both within and outside of the project.
